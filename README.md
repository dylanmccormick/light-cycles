# Light Cycles

Hello and welcome to light cycles. This is based on the [Light Cycle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)#:~:text=in%20the%20shield.-,Light%20Cycles,-In%20a%20player>) portion of the old Tron arcade game. The goal of this project is to refine my knowledge of websockets and TUIs to create a two player version of light cycles. 

## Stack
Why go? I think Go is a great language for writing server applications. Go is the language for many large and open source projects including Kubernetes and OpenTofu (Terraform fork).

Why websockets? They are cool

## How to run
<!-- TODO -->


## TODO:

1. Create menu screens and commands.  
    - Start game - done
    - restart game - done
2. Display messages for updates from the game (countdown timer)
    - I think all of this stuff is just sent in game state? I'm not sure but I think that's like a good practice. 

- Player hitting key opposite of current direction kills self

## V2:
- Server with rooms

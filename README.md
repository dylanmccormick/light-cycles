# Light Cycles

Hello and welcome to light cycles. This is based on the [Light Cycle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(video_game)#:~:text=in%20the%20shield.-,Light%20Cycles,-In%20a%20player>) portion of the old Tron arcade game. The goal of this project is to refine my knowledge of websockets and TUIs to create a two player version of light cycles.

Why go? I think Go is a great language for writing server applications. Go is the language for many large and open source projects including Kubernetes and OpenTofu (Terraform fork).

Why websockets? They are cool
